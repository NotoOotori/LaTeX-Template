\begin{abstract}{交换幺环, 代数簇, 素谱, 概型}
  代数几何历史悠久而又充满活力, 与其它数学分支有着深刻的联系, 是一门重要的学科. 代数几何包含代数与几何, 可以认为是将代数理论应用到几何的研究之中.

  代数几何的理论根基在于代数. 本文从基本定义开始建立了以环论为主模论为辅的交换代数理论, 研究了商环与分式环的基本性质, 证明了Noether环上准素分解的存在性及其满足的唯一性, 以域论为基础利用Noether正规化引理证明了域的有限生成整环上的维数定理和Hilbert零点定理.

  代数几何的研究对象在于几何. 本文研究了固定代数闭域上的仿射与射影空间中的代数集, 建立了根式理想与代数集之间的对应, 并逐步建立了代数簇与素谱之间的对应, 最终引出了概型的概念. 在此过程中, 本文将代数中的准素分解, 维数理论与几何相联系, 并将Noether模论应用到几何中.

\begin{abstract*}{commutative ring, algebraic variety, prime spectrum, scheme}
  This dissertation provides a general introduction to algebraic geometry, which is one of the oldest and the most active subjects in mathematics with deep connections to almost all other branches.

  Algebraic geometry lays its foundation on algebra. The author establishes the theory of commutative algebra with emphasis on ideals, where modules are also mentioned. Quotient rings and fraction rings have been studied, and existence and uniqueness of primary decomposition in Noetherian rings have been proved. Moreover, dimension theory of finitely generated domains has been carried out by means of Noetherian normalization lemma, with Hilbert's Nullstellensatz becoming a direct corollary.

  Algebraic geometry marks geometry as its main subject. The author researches on algebraic sets in affine and projective spaces over a fixed algebraically closed field, and establishes the order-reversing correspondence between algebraic sets and radical ideals. Then the author builds up the connection between algebraic varieties and prime spectrums step by step, with the structure of sheaves involved, which eventually leads to the concept of schemes. During this process, algebraic theories, e.g. primary decomposition, dimension theory and Noetherian module theory, have been applied to geometry.
