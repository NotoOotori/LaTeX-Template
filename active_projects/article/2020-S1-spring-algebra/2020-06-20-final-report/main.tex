    \section{Categories}

    In this section, we will introduce the definition of a category. Category is an abstract mathematical concept, which focuses on not only mathematical objects, but also morphisms between them.

    \begin{definition}[Category]
        A \emph{category} is a class $\mathscr{C}$ of objects (denoted by $A, B, C, \dotsc$) together with
        \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
            \item a class of disjoint sets, denoted by $\Hom(A, B)$, one for each pair of objects in $\mathscr{C}$; (an element of $\Hom(A, B)$ is called a \emph{morphism} from $A$ to $B$ and is denoted by $f\colon A\to B$);
            \item for each triple $(A, B, C)$ of objects of $\mathscr{C}$ a function
            \begin{equation}
                \Hom(B, C)\times \Hom(A, B)\to \Hom(A, C);
            \end{equation}
            (for morphisms $f\colon A\to B, g\colon B\to C$, this function is written $(g, f)\mapsto g\circ f$ and $g\circ f\colon A\to C$ is called the \emph{composite} of $f$ and $g$); all subject to the two axioms:
            \begin{enumerate}[\hspace{-1em}(I)]
                \item Associativity. If $f\colon A\to B, g\colon B\to C, h\colon C\to D$ are morphisms of $\SC$, then $h\circ (g\circ f) = (h\circ g)\circ f$.
                \item Identity. For each object $B$ of $\SC$ there exists a morphism $1_B\colon B\to B$ such that for any $f\colon A\to B, g\colon B\to C$,
                \begin{equation}
                    1_B \circ f = f\quad\text{and}\quad g\circ 1_B = g.
                \end{equation}
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}

        In a category $\SC$ a morphism $f\colon A\to B$ is called an \emph{equivalence} if there is in $\SC$ a morphism $g\colon B\to A$ such that $g\circ f = 1_A$ and $f\circ g = 1_B$.
    \end{definition}

    Note that in the definition of a category, an object is not necessarily a set and a morphism is not necessarily a map between sets. We may exclude these cases and consider all categories to be concrete in the sequel.

    \begin{definition}[Concrete Category]
        A category $\SC$ is called a \emph{concrete category} provided that
        \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
            \item every object is a set;
            \item every morphism of $\Hom(A, B)$ is a map on the sets $A\to B$ for each pair of objects $(A, B)$;
            \item composition of morphisms agrees with composition of maps on the sets;
            \item the identity morphism of each object $A$ is the identity map on the set $A$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}[Category of Finite Dimensional Linear Spaces]
        Let $\mathscr{V}_\text{\it finite}$ denote the class of all finite dimensional linear spaces over $\BC$. Let $\Hom(V, W)$ be the set of all linear maps from $V$ to $W$. Then $\mathscr{V}_\text{\it finite}$ is a concrete category and is called the \emph{category of finite dimensional linear spaces}.
    \end{example}

    Sometimes we may be interested in those concrete categories each of which contains exactly one object.

    \begin{definition}[Structure]
        A concrete category is called a \emph{structure} provided that it contains exactly one object $C$. We usually denote a structure by the same symbol of its letter but with a different font $\mathcal{C}$. The set of all equivalences in $\mathcal{C}$ forms a group with the composite operation which is called the \emph{automorphism group} of the structure and is denoted by $\Aut(\mathcal{C})$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}[Set Structure]
        Let $\mathcal{X}$ be the set of a given set $X$. Let $\Hom(X, X)$ be the set of all maps on $X$. Then $\mathcal{X}$ is easily seen to be a structure, which is called a \emph{set structure}.
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}[Group Structure]
        Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the set of a given group $G$. Let $\Hom(G, G)$ be the set of all endomorphisms of groups $G\to G$. Then $\mathcal{G}$ is easily seen to be a structure, which is called a \emph{group structure}.
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}[Linear Space Structure]
        Let $\mathcal{V}\subseteq \mathscr{V}_{\text{\it finite}}$ be the set of a given finite dimensional linear space $V$ over $\BC$. Let $\Hom(V, V)$ be the set of all morphisms $V\to V$ in $\mathscr{V}_{\text{\it finite}}$. Then $\mathcal{V}$ is easily seen to be a structure, which is called a \emph{group structure}. An equivalence in $\mathcal{V}$ is an linear transformation on $V$. Thus the automorphism group of a linear space structure $\mathcal{V}$ is also called a \emph{general linear group} of $V$ and is denoted by $\GL(V)$.
    \end{example}

    \section{Group Actions}

    In this section, we will introduce the definition of group actions and derive the class equation of any finite group.

    \begin{definition}[Action]
        An \emph{action} of a group $G$ on a structure $\mathcal{C}$ is a group homomorphism $\phi\colon G\to \Aut(\mathcal{C})$. We usually write $\phi_g$ for $\phi(g)$ and $\phi_g(x)$ for $\phi(g)(x)$ where $x\in C\in \mathcal{C}$.
    \end{definition}

    In particular, an action of the group $G$ on a set $X$ is a group homomorphism from $G$ to the group $S_X$ of all bijections on $X$.

    \begin{example}[Conjugation]
        Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a group structure. The action $\phi\colon G\to \Aut(\mathcal{G})$ given by $\phi_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$ is called \emph{conjugation} and the element $gxg^{-1}$ is said to be a \emph{conjugate} of $x$.
    \end{example}

    A group action on a structure $\mathcal{C}$ can derive an equivalence class on $C$, which is essential in counting theory.

    \begin{theorem}
        Let $G$ be a group that acts on a structure $\mathcal{C}$. The relation on $C$ defined by
        \begin{equation}
            x\sim x' \Longleftrightarrow \phi_g(x) = x'\text{ for some }g\in G
        \end{equation}
        is an equivalence relation.
    \end{theorem}

    The equivalence classes of the equivalence relation are called the \emph{orbits} of $G$ on $\mathcal{C}$; the orbit of $x\in C$ is denoted by $\overline{c}$.

    \begin{proof}
        It follows from the fact that $\phi$ is a homomorphism from group $G$. (transitivity follows from associativity, reflexivity follows from the existance of an identity element, and symmetry follows from the existance of an inverse element).
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
        Let $G$ be a group that acts on a structure $\mathcal{C}$. For each $x\in C$, $G_x=\{g\in G|\ \phi_g(x) = x\}$ is a subgroup of $G$.
    \end{theorem}

    The subgroup $G_x$ is called the \emph{stabilizer} of $x$.

    \begin{example}
        Let a group $G$ acts on the group structure $\mathcal{G}$ by conjugation. The orbit $\{gxg^{-1}|\ g\in G\}$ of $x\in G$ is called the \emph{conjugacy class} of $x$ and the stabilizer $G_x=\{g\in G|\ gxg^{-1} = x\}$ is called the \emph{centralizer} of $x$ and is denoted by $C_G(x)$.
    \end{example}

    The next theorem counts the cardinal number of any orbit, which will directly induce the group equation of a finite group.

    \begin{theorem}
        If a group $G$ acts on a structure $\mathcal{C}$, then the cardinal number of the orbit of $x\in C$ is the index $[G:G_x]$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        The map given by $gG_x\mapsto \phi_g(x)$ from the set of all cosets of $G_x$ in $G$ to the orbit $\overline{x}$ is a well-defined bijection since $x$ runs through $G$ and
        \begin{equation}
            \phi_g(x)=\phi_{g'}(x)\Longleftrightarrow \phi_{g^{-1}g'}(x)=x\Longleftrightarrow g^{-1}g'\in G_x\Longleftrightarrow gG_x = g'G_x.
        \end{equation}
        It completes the proof.
    \end{proof}

    Apply the previous theorem to the conjugacy action of a finite group $G$ on $\mathcal{G}$ and notice that the cardinal of a finite set equals to the sum of the cardinals of all equivalence classes, we can derive the class equation, as desired.

    \begin{corollary}[Class Equation]
        If $G$ is a finite group and $\{\overline{x_1}, \dotsc, \overline{x_n}\}$ is the set of all conjugacy classes of $G$, then the equation
        \begin{equation}
            |G| = \sum_{i=1}^n[G: C_G(x_i)]
        \end{equation}
        is called the \emph{class equation} of the finite group $G$.
    \end{corollary}

    Given a group $G$ and a category $\mathscr{C}$. The class of all actions of $G$ on a arbitrary structure $\mathcal{C}$ of the category $\mathscr{C}$ can form a category by defining the morphism between actions.

    \begin{definition}[Category of Group Actions]
        Let $G$ be a group and $\mathscr{C}$ be a concrete category with $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'\subseteq \mathscr{C}$ to be two structures. Let $\phi\colon G\to \Aut(\mathcal{C})$ and $\phi'\colon G\to\Aut(\mathcal{C}')$ be group actions. A morphism from $\phi$ to $\phi'$ is by definition a morphism $f\colon C\to C'$ in $\mathscr{C}$ such that $f\phi_g = \phi'_gf$ for all $g\in G$. Then the class of all actions of $G$ on any structure $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathscr{C}$ is a category and is denoted by $\mathscr{C}_G$. The set of all morphisms from $\phi$ to $\phi'$ is denoted by $\Hom_G(\phi, \phi')$. Notice that $\Hom_{G}(\phi, \phi')\subseteq \Hom(V, W)$.
    \end{definition}

    \section{Symmetric Groups: Conjugacy Classes and Class Equations}

    In this section, we will study the conjugacy classes of the symmetric group $S_n$, in order to give an explicit form of the class equation on $S_n$ $(n\geq 3)$.

    We will assume $n\geq 3$ when talking about the symmetric group $S_n$.

    Recall that an element $\sigma$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ is a bijection on $I_n = \{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ and is called a \emph{permutaion}.
    A \emph{cycle} denoted by $(i_1 i_2 \dotsb i_k)$ is a permutation which maps $i_1\mapsto i_2, \dotsc, i_{k-1}\mapsto i_k$ and $i_k\mapsto i_1$ and maps every other element to itself.

    It is widely known that every permutation $\tau$ can be uniquely (up to the order of the factors) written as a product of disjoint cycles, where each cycle corresponds to an orbit of the group action on the set $I_n$ by the group $\lr<>\tau < S_n$ with the length of the cycle to be equal to the cardinal of the orbit. Since the sum of the cardinals of all orbits equals to $n$, thus $\tau$ corresponds to a partition of $n$, which is called the \emph{cycle type} of the permutation $\tau$ and denoted by $\Type(\tau)$. Namely, $\Type(\tau)=(\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_r)$ in decreasing order with multiplicity.

    The next lemma is one of the exercises in the Algebra course and is proved to be useful to identify the conjugacy classes of $S_n$.

    \begin{lemma}
        If $\sigma = (i_1 i_2 \dotsb i_r)\in S_n$ and $\tau\in S_n$, then $\tau\sigma\tau^{-1}$ is the $r$-cycle $\left(\tau(i_1) \tau(i_2) \dotsb \tau(i_r)\right)$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{theorem}
        Let $\sigma, \sigma'\in S_n$ be two permutations. If there is some $\tau\in S_n$ such that $\sigma'=\tau\sigma\tau^{-1}$, then $\Type(\sigma)=\Type(\tau\sigma\tau^{-1}) = \Type(\sigma')$. Conversely, if $\Type(\sigma) = \Type(\sigma')$, then there exists such permutation $\tau$ that $\sigma' = \tau\sigma\tau^{-1}$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        For the first part of the theorem, suppose $\Type(\sigma) = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_r)$ and $\sigma=\sigma_1\dotsb\sigma_r$ be the product of disjoint cycles where $\lambda_i$ is the length of $\sigma_i$. Then $\sigma' = \tau\sigma\tau^{-1} = \sigma'_1\dotsb \sigma'_r$ is also a product of disjoint cycles where $\sigma'_i = \tau\sigma_i\tau^{-1}$. Notice that $\sigma_i'$ and $\sigma_i$ share the same length for $i= 1, \dotsc, r$. Thus $\Type(\sigma') = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_r) = \Type(\sigma)$.

        For the second part of the theorem, let $\sigma=\sigma_1\dotsb\sigma_r$ and $\sigma'=\sigma'_1\dotsb\sigma_r$ be the products of disjoint cycles where corresponding cycles share the same length. Then we can choose such $\tau_i$ that $\tau\sigma_i\tau^{-1}=\sigma_i'$, and let $\tau = \tau_1\dotsb\tau_r$, which satisfies the desired property.
    \end{proof}

    Since the conjugacy class of a permutation has exactly one element if and only if the permutation consists of 1-cycles, namely the permutation is the identity element. It follows the corollary.

    \begin{corollary}
        The center of $S_n$ is a trivial group (for $n \geq 3$).
    \end{corollary}

    In the next theorem we will compute the cardinal of each conjugacy class of $S_n$ by means of multiplication principle from combinatorics.

    \begin{theorem}
        If $\sigma\in S_n$, then the cardinal of the centralizer of $\sigma$
        \begin{equation}
            |C_G(\sigma)| = \prod_{i=1}^ni^{c_i(\sigma)}c_i(\sigma)!,
        \end{equation}
        where $c_i(\sigma)$ stands for the number of $i$-orbits of the group action on $I_n$ by $\lr<>\sigma$, namely the number of $i$-cycles in the cyclic form of $\sigma$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        Any $\tau\in S_n$ can either permute the cycles of length $i$ among themselves or perform a cyclic rotation on each of the individual cycles (or both). Since there are $c_i(\sigma)!$ ways to do the former operation and $i^{c_i(\sigma)}$ ways to do the latter, we are done.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        The group equation of $S_n$ is
        \begin{equation}
            n! = \sum_{c_1+2c_2+\dotsb+nc_n=n}\frac{n!}{\prod_{i=1}^ni^{c_i}c_i!},
        \end{equation}
        where $c_1, \dotsc, c_n$ are nonnegative integers.
    \end{corollary}

    \section{Group Representations}

    In this section, we will study the definition of a group representation and a irreducible representation, and state the existance and uniqueness of decomposing a representation of a finite group into irreducible ones.

    \begin{definition}[Representation]
        A \emph{representation} of a group is a group action on some linear space structure $\mathcal{V}$, that is a homomorphism $\phi\colon G\to\GL(V)$ where $V$ is a finite dimensional linear space over $\BC$.
    \end{definition}

    We shall tacitly assume in this text that representations are non-zero, although this is not formally part of the definition.

    Recall that we have defined the category of group actions and hence the one of group representations.

    \begin{definition}[Equivalence]
        Two representations $\phi\colon G\to \GL(V)$ and $\psi\colon G\to\GL(W)$ are said to be equivalent if there exists an isomorphism $T\colon V\to W$ in such that $T\phi_g = \psi_gT$ for all $g\in G$. In this case, we write $\phi\sim\psi$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[$G$-invariant Subspace]
        Let $\phi\colon G\to \GL(V)$ be a representation. A subspace $W\leq V$ is $G$-\emph{invariant} if, for all $g\in G$ and $w\in W$, one has $\phi_gw\in W$.
    \end{definition}

    Sometimes one may say $\phi|_W$ is a subrepresentation of $\phi$.

    \begin{definition}[Direct Sum]
        Gven the representations $\phi\colon G\to \GL(V)$ and $\psi\colon G\to\GL(W)$. Then their \emph{direct sum}
        \begin{equation}
            \phi\oplus\psi\colon G\to\GL(V\oplus W)
        \end{equation}
        is given by
        \begin{equation}
            (\phi\oplus\psi)_g(v, w) = (\phi_g(v), \psi_g(w)).
        \end{equation}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Irreducible Representation]
        A non-zero representation $\phi\colon G\to \GL(V)$ of a group $G$ is said to be \emph{irreducible} if the only $G$-invariant subspace of $V$ are $\{0\}$ and $V$.
    \end{definition}

    The next theorem tells that every representation of a finite group can be written as the direct sum of irreducible ones.

    \section{Symmetric Groups: Young Tableaux and Irreducible Representations}

    We have shown that each conjugacy class of a symmetric group of $n$ letters corresponds to a positive partition of $n$. In this section, we will construct one irreducible representation of $S_n$ for each partition of $n$ and will prove that any two representations of them are not equivalent by means of Young tableaux.

    \begin{definition}[Partition]
        A \emph{partition} of $n$ is a tuple $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_l)$ of positive integers such that $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \dotsb \geq \lambda_l$ and $\lambda_1+\dotsb + \lambda_l=n$. Denote $\lambda\vdash n$ to indicate that $\lambda$ is a partition of $n$.
    \end{definition}

    Now we are ready to introduce the definition of Young diagram. It is a variation of Ferrers diagram which we have studied in the Combinatorics courses, with the dots replaced by boxes where numbers can be placed.

    \begin{definition}[Young Diagram]
        If $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_l)$ is a partition of $n$, then the \emph{Young diagram} of $\lambda$ consists of $n$ boxes placed into $l$ rows where the $i$th row has $\lambda_i$ boxes.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Conjugate Partition]
        If $\lambda\vdash n$, then the \emph{conjugate partition} $\lambda^T$ of $\lambda$ is the partition whose Young diagram is the transpose of the diagram of $\lambda$. An example is shown in \ref{fig: young-diagram}.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{figure}[htb]
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
            \centering
            \begin{ytableau}

            \end{ytableau}
            \caption{$\lambda=(3, 2)$}
        \end{subfigure}
        \hfill
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
            \centering
            \begin{ytableau}
                {} & {} \\
                {} & {} \\
                {}
            \end{ytableau}
            \caption{$\lambda^T = (2, 2, 1)$}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Young diagram of $\lambda=(3, 2)$ and its conjugate partition.}
        \label{fig: young-diagram}
    \end{figure}

    We can define a partial order, denoted $\unrhd$, on the set of all Young diagrams of given integer $n$, where $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_l)\unrhd \mu = (\mu_1, \dotsc, \mu_m)$ if and only of
    \begin{equation}
        \lambda_1 + \dotsb + \lambda_i \geq \mu_1 + \dotsb + \mu_i
    \end{equation}
    for all $i\geq 1$, where we take $\lambda_i = 0$ ($\mu_i = 0$ resp.) if $i>l$ ($i>m$ resp.). The partial order is called the \emph{domination order}. We write $\lambda\rhd\mu$ if $\lambda\unrhd\mu$ and $\lambda\neq\mu$.

    \begin{theorem}
        The dominance order satisfies:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Reflexivity: $\lambda\unrhd\lambda$;
            \item Anti-symmetry: $(\lambda\unrhd\mu)\wedge(\mu\unrhd\lambda)\Leftrightarrow(\lambda=\mu)$;
            \item Transitivity: $(\lambda\unrhd\mu)\wedge(\mu\unrhd\rho)\Leftrightarrow(\lambda\unrhd\rho)$;
        \end{enumerate}
        that is to say, the dominance order is a partial order.
    \end{theorem}

    Young tableaux are obtained from Young diagrams by placing the distinct integers $1, \dotsc, n$ into the boxes.

    \begin{definition}[Young Tableaux]
        If $\lambda\vdash n$, then a $\lambda$-\emph{tableau} is an array $t$ of integers, usually denoted by $t^\lambda$, obtained by placing $1, \dotsc, n$ into the boxes of the Young diagram for $\lambda$.
    \end{definition}

    There is a rather technical combinatorial fact which is useful in the sequel is that if $t^\lambda$ is a $\lambda$-tableau and $s^\mu$ is a $\mu$-tableau such that the integers in any given row of $s^\mu$ belong to distinct columns of $t^\lambda$, then $\lambda\unrhd\mu$. We shall prove the fact through a lemma.

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem: tableaux}
        Let $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_l)$ and $\mu = (\mu_1, \dotsc, \mu_m)$ be partitions of $n$. Suppose that $t^\lambda$ is a $\lambda$-tableau and $s^\mu$ is a $\mu$-tableau such that entries in the same row of $s^\mu$ are located in different columns of $t^\lambda$. Then we can find a $\lambda$-tableau $u^\lambda$ such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The $j$th columns of $t^\lambda$ and $u^\lambda$ contain the same elements for $1\leq j \leq l$;
            \item The entries of the first $i$ rows of $s^\mu$ belong to the first $i$ rows of $u^\lambda$ for each $1\leq i \leq m$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        We will prove the lemma by constructing a $\lambda$-tableau $t_r^\lambda$ such that
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item The $j$th columns of $t^\lambda$ and $t_r^\lambda$ contain the same elements for $1\leq j\leq l$;
            \item The entries of the first $i$ rows of $s^\mu$ belong to the first $i$ rows of $t_r^\lambda$ for $1\leq i \leq r$
        \end{enumerate}
        by induction. Setting $u^\lambda = t_m^\lambda$ will complete the proof.

        When $r=1$, let $k$ be an element in the first row of $s^\mu$ and denote by $c(k)$ the column of $t^\lambda$ containing $k$. Then switch the first entry of column $c(k)$ with $k$.

        Now suppose that $t_r^\lambda$ has been constructed for $r$, we shall construct $t_{r+1}^\lambda$ from $t_r^\lambda$ as follows. Again, let $k$ be an element in the row $r+1$ of $s^\mu$. If $k$ is in the first $r+1$ rows of $t_r^\lambda$, then it is done. Otherwise, since $\lambda\unrhd\mu$, then the column $c(k)$ must intersect the row $r+1$ of $t_{r+1}^\lambda$, that is, the row $r+1$ must have at least $c(k)$ entries. Then we can switch $k$ with the entry $c(k)$ of row $r+1$ for each such $k$ independently, in order to get the tableau $t_{r+1}^\lambda$ satisfying desired properties.
    \end{proof}

    It follows immediately from the lemma that $\lambda\unrhd\mu$ by restating the property (b) for $u^\lambda = t_m^\lambda$. Hence we have proved the dominance lemma, which is stated as follows.

    \begin{lemma}[Dominance Lemma]\label{lem: dom}
        Let $\lambda$ and $\mu$ be partitions of $n$ and suppose that $t^\lambda$ and $s^\mu$ are tableaux of respective shapes $\lambda$ and $\mu$. Moreover, supposes that integers in the same row of $s^\mu$ are located in different columns of $t^\lambda$. Then $\lambda\unrhd\mu$.
    \end{lemma}

    In the next part, we shall construct the irreducible representations for $S_n$. We need some definitions first.

    \begin{definition}
        Let $t$ be a Young tableau. Then the \emph{column stablizer} $C_t$ of $t$ is the subgroup of $S_n$ preserving the columns of $t$, that is, $\sigma\in C_t$ if and only if $\sigma(i)$ is in the same column as $i$ for every $i\in \{1, \dotsc, n\}$.
    \end{definition}

    In the previous proof of Lemma \ref{lem: tableaux}, the transformation from $t^\lambda$ to $u^\lambda$ was actually a column stablizer.

    \begin{definition}[Tabloid]
        Define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on the set of all $\lambda$-tableaux by putting $t_1\sim t_2$ only if they have the same entries in each row. Call a $\sim$-equivalence class of $\lambda$-tableaux a $\lambda$-\emph{tabloid}, which is denoted by $[t]$. Denote by $T^\lambda$ the set of all $\lambda$-tabloids and by $T_\lambda$ the tabloid which has $j$ in the $j$th box.
    \end{definition}

    The action of $S_n$ on $\lambda$-tableaux induces an action of $S_n$ on $\lambda$-tabloids since $t_1\sim t_2$ implies $\sigma t_1\sim \sigma t_2$. Suppose that $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_l)$. Let $S_\lambda$ the stablizer of $T_\lambda$, which is called the \emph{Young subgroup} associated to the partition $\lambda$.

    For a partition $\lambda$, set $M^\lambda = \BC T^\lambda$ and let $\phi^\lambda\colon S_n\to \GL(M^\lambda)$ be the associated permutation representation, that is
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_\sigma^\lambda\lr(){\sum_{[t]\in T^\lambda}c_{[t]}[t]} = \sum_{[t]\in T^\lambda}c_{[t]}\sigma[t].
    \end{equation}

    If $\lambda\neq (n)$, then $\phi^\lambda$ is not irreducible. Hence we need to isolate the irreducible constituent from it.

    \begin{definition}[Polytabloid]
        Let $\lambda, \mu\vdash n$. Let $t$ be a $\lambda$-tableau and define a linear operator $A_t\colon M^\mu\to M^\mu$ by
        \begin{equation}
            A_t = \sum_{\pi\in C_t}\sgn(\pi)\phi^\mu_\pi.
        \end{equation}
        In the case $\lambda=\mu$, the element
        \begin{equation}
            e_t = A_t[t] = \sum_{\pi\in C_t}\sgn(\pi)\pi[t]
        \end{equation}
        of $M^\lambda$ is called the polytabloid associated to $t$.
    \end{definition}

    We shall now show that the subspace of $M^\lambda$ spanned by all polytabloids $e_t$ with $t$ a $\lambda$-tableau is in fact a $S_n$-invariant subspace of $M^\lambda$.

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm: poly-commu}
        If $\sigma\in S_n$ and $t$ is a $\lambda$-tableau, then $\phi_\sigma^\lambda e_t = e_{\sigma t}$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        Notice that $\tau(X) = X$ if and only if $\sigma\tau\sigma^{-1}(\sigma(X)) = \sigma(X)$ where $X\subseteq I_n$. Hence $C_{\sigma t}=\sigma C_t\sigma^{-1}$. Now we compute
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                \phi_\sigma^\lambda e_t &= \phi_\sigma^\lambda A_t[t]\\
                &= \sum_{\pi\in C_t}\sgn(\pi)\phi_\sigma^\lambda \pi [t]\\
                &= \sum_{\sigma\pi\sigma^{-1}\in C_{\sigma t}}\sgn(\sigma\pi\sigma^{-1})\sigma\pi\sigma^{-1}[\sigma t]\\
                &= e_{\sigma t}.
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        It ends the proof.
    \end{proof}

    We can now define our desired subrepresentation.
    \begin{definition}[Sprecht Representation]
        Let $\lambda$ be a partition of $n$. Define $S^\lambda$ to be the subspace of $M^\lambda$ spanned by the polytabloids $e_t$ with $t$ a $\lambda$-tableau. Let $\psi^\lambda\colon S_n\to \GL(S^\lambda)$ be the subrepresentation of $\phi^\lambda\colon S_n\to \GL(M^\lambda)$. It is called the \emph{Sprecht representation} associated to $\lambda$.
    \end{definition}

    We shall show that $\psi^\lambda$ are the irreducible representations of $S_n$ and each two of them are not equivalent.

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem: Ats}
        Let $\lambda, \mu\vdash n$ and suppose that $t^\lambda$ is a $\lambda$-tableau and $s^\mu$ is a $\mu$-tableau such that $A_{t^\lambda}[s^\mu]\neq 0$. Then $\lambda\unrhd\mu$. Moreover, if $\lambda=\mu$, then $A_{t^\lambda}[s^\mu]=\pm e_{t^\lambda}$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        We shall use the Dominance Lemma to prove the first assertion. Suppose there are two elements $i, j$ that are in the same row of $s^\mu$ and in the same column of $t^\lambda$. Then $(i j)s^\mu = s^\mu$ and $(i j)\in C_{t^\lambda}$. Let $H=\{\id, (i j)\}$ be the subgroup of $C_{t^\lambda}$, and let $\sigma_1, \dotsc, \sigma_k$ be a complete set of left cosets for $H$ in $C_{t^\lambda}$, that is to say, $\sigma_1H\cup\dotsb \cup \sigma_kH = C_{t^\lambda}$. Then we have
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                A_{t^\lambda}[s^\mu] &= \sum_{\pi\in C_{t^\lambda}}\sgn(\pi)\phi_\pi^\mu[s^\mu]\\
                &= \sum_{r=1}^k \lr(){\sgn(\sigma_r)\phi_{\sigma r}^\mu + \sgn(\sigma_r(i j))\phi_{\sigma_r(i j)}^\mu}[s^\mu]\\
                &= \sum_{r=1}^k\sgn(\sigma_r)\phi_{\sigma_r}^\mu(\phi_\id^\mu-\phi_{(i j)}\mu)[s^\mu]\\
                &= 0.
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        It follows from Lemma \ref{lem: dom} that if $A_{t^\lambda}[s^\mu]\neq 0$, then $\lambda\vdash\mu$.

        Next suppose that $\lambda=\mu$. Lemma \ref{lem: tableaux} states that there is a $\lambda$-tableau $u^\lambda = \sigma t^\lambda$, where $\sigma\in C_{t^\lambda}$, such that the entries of the first $i$ rows of $s^\mu$ belong to the first $i$ rows of $u^\lambda$ for each $1\leq i\leq m$. Since $\lambda=\mu$, we can prove by induction that $[u^\lambda]=[s^\mu]$. It follows that
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                A_{t^\lambda}[s^\mu]
                &= \sum_{\pi\in C_{t^\lambda}}\sgn(\pi)\phi_\pi^\mu[s^\mu]\\
                &= \sum_{\tau\sigma^{-1}\in C_{t^\lambda}}\sgn(\tau\sigma^{-1})\phi_{\tau\sigma^{-1}}^\lambda[u^\lambda]\\
                &= \sgn(\sigma^{-1})\sum_{\tau\in C_{t^\lambda}}\sgn(\tau)\phi_\tau^\lambda[t^\lambda]\\
                &= \sgn(\sigma^{-1})e_{t^\lambda},
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        which completes the proof.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem: At}
        Let $t$ be a $\lambda$-tableau. Then the image of the operator $A_t\colon M^\lambda\to M^\lambda$ is $\BC e_t$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Notice that $A_t[s]$ equals either $\pm e_t$ or 0, for $[s]$ being any $\lambda$-tabloid. It follows the assertion.
    \end{proof}

    Recall that $M^\lambda = \BC T^\lambda$ has an inner product structure where $T^\lambda$ is an orthonormal basis. Notice that $\phi^\lambda_\sigma$ is unitary, and its adjoint is $(\phi^\lambda_\sigma)^*=\phi^\lambda_{\sigma^{-1}}$, for all $\sigma\in S_n$. It follows that
    \begin{equation}
        A_t^* = \sum_{\pi\in C_t}\sgn(\pi)(\phi^\lambda_\pi)^* = \sum_{\pi^{-1}\in C_t}\sgn(\pi^{-1})(\phi^\lambda_{\pi^{-1}}) = A_t,
    \end{equation}
    which means that $A_t$ is self-adjoint.

    The following theorem is the key to prove that the $\psi^\lambda$ are the irreducible representations of $S_n$.

    \begin{theorem}[Subrepresentation Theorem]\label{thm: subrepr}
        Let $\lambda$ be a partition of $n$ and suppose that $V$ is an $S_n$-invariant subspace of $M^\lambda$. Then either $S^\lambda\subseteq V$ or $V\subseteq (S^\lambda)^\perp$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        First suppose that there is some $\lambda$-tableau $t$ and some vector $v\in V$ such that $A_t(v)\neq 0$. Since $V$ is a $S_n$-invariant subspace, then we have
        \begin{equation}
            A_t(v)=\sum_{\pi\in C_t}\sgn(\pi)\phi_\pi^\lambda(v)\in V.
        \end{equation}
        By Lemma \ref{lem: At}, we have $A_t(v)\in V\cap \BC e_t$. Thus $e_t\in V$. Again by the fact that the $V$ is $S_n$-invariant, $e_{\sigma t} = \phi^\lambda_\sigma e_t\in V$. Thus $S^\lambda\subseteq V$.

        Next suppose that for any $\lambda$-tableau $t$ and any vector $v\in V$, we have $A_t(v) = 0$. Then we compute
        \begin{equation}
            \lr<>{v, e_t} = \lr<>{v, A_t[t]} = \lr<>{A_tv, [t]} = 0.
        \end{equation}
        Since $v$ and $e_t$ are arbitrary, we have $V\subseteq (S^\lambda)^\perp$. It ends the proof.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        Let $\lambda\vdash n$. Then $\psi^\lambda\colon S_n\to \GL(S^\lambda)$ is irreducible.
    \end{corollary}

    It remains to be shown that $\lambda\neq\mu$ implies that $\psi^\lambda\nsim\psi^\mu$. Let's start with some lemmas. Recall that $T\in \Hom_{S_n}(\phi^\lambda, \phi^\mu)$ if and only if $T\phi^\lambda_\sigma = \phi^\mu_\sigma$ for $\sigma\in S_n$.

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem: T-hom}
        Suppose that $\lambda, \mu\vdash n$ and let $T\in \Hom_{S_n}(\phi^\lambda, \phi^\mu)$. If $S^\lambda\nsubseteq \Kernal(T)$, then $\lambda\unrhd \mu$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        Recall that $\Kernal(T)$ is a $S_n$-invariant subspace. It follows from Theorem \ref{thm: subrepr} that\\ $\Kernal(T)\subseteq(S^\lambda)^\perp$. Hence for any $\lambda$-tableau $t$, there is $0\leq Te_t = TA_t[t]=A_tT[t]$, where it should be noticed that the two $A_t$ in the last equation have different domains. Since $T[t]$ is a linear combination of $\mu$-tabloids, there exists a $\mu$-tabloid $[s]$ such that $A_t[s]\neq 0$. By Lemma \ref{lem: Ats} we have $\lambda\unrhd\mu$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem: hom-ker}
        If $\Hom_{S_n}(\psi^\lambda, \phi^\mu)\neq 0$, then $\lambda\unrhd \mu$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        We can extend any non-zero morphism $T\colon S^\lambda\to M^\mu$ by putting $T(v+w)=Tv$ for elements $v\in S^\lambda$ and $w\in (S^\lambda)^\perp$. Notice that $(S^\lambda)^\perp$ is $S_n$-invariant since $(\phi_\sigma^\lambda)=\phi_{\sigma^{-1}}^\lambda$. Thus the extension is also a morphism. Clearly $S^\lambda\nsubseteq\Kernal(T)$ and so $\lambda\unrhd\mu$ by Lemma \ref{lem: T-hom}.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
        The Sprecht representations $\psi^\lambda$ with $\lambda\vdash n$ form a complete set of inequivalent irreducible representations of $S_n$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        Suppose that $\psi^\lambda\sim\psi^\mu$, then
        \begin{equation}
            0\neq \Hom_{S_n}(\psi^\lambda, \psi^\mu)\subseteq \Hom_{S_n}(\psi^\lambda, \phi^\mu).
        \end{equation}
        Thus by Lemma \ref{lem: hom-ker}, we have $\lambda\unrhd\mu$. A symmetric argument shows that $\mu\unrhd\lambda$. Thus we have $\lambda=\mu$ if $\psi^\lambda\sim\psi^\mu$, as desired.
    \end{proof}

    \section{Dimensions of the Irreducible Representations}

    In this section, we shall compute the dimension of $S^\lambda$ for each partition $\lambda\vdash n$ by the following procedure. First we shall rove the set of polytabloids associated with standard $\lambda$-tableaux is linear independent and generates $S^\lambda$. Then we shall compute the number of standard $\lambda$-tablaux by Hook length formula.

    \begin{definition}[Standard Young Tableaux]
        A young tableau is called \emph{standard} provided that the entries along the rows and down the columns are ordered in increasing values. In this case we call the corresponding tabloid and polytabloid standard.
    \end{definition}

    We shall prove by induction that the polytabloids associated with standard tableaux are linear independent, where we need a linear order first.

    \begin{lemma}
        Suppose $\lambda\vdash n$ and $[t], [u]$ are two $\lambda$-tabloid. Then we say $[t]>[u]$ if there exists some $i$ such that,
        \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
            \item for all $j>i$, $j$ is in the same row of both $[t]$ and $[u]$;
            \item $i$ is in a higher row of $[t]$ than $[u]$, where the first row is the highest row;
        \end{enumerate}
        and we say $[t]\geq [u]$ if $[t]>[u]$ or $[t]=[u]$. The relation $\leq$ is a linear order on the set of standard Young tableaux.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        Notice that if $[t]\neq [u]$, then there exists a greatest integer $i\leq n$ such that $i$ is in different row of $[t]$ and $[u]$. The proof is then a routine.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem: leq}
        Suppose $t$ is a tableau and $\pi$ is a column stablizer of $t$. Then $\pi [t]\geq [t]$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $i$ is the greatest integer such that $\pi (i)\neq i$. Thus all $j>i$ are not permuted. Since $\pi$ is a column stablizer and the columns are in in ascending order. Then the entry of $t$ with value $i$ must be permutated to a higher row. It ends the proof.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
        The polytabloids associated with the standard tableaux are linearly independent.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        Let $t_1> t_2 > \dotsc > t_r$ be all standard tableaux. Suppose there is a linear combination of the associated polytabloids that gives 0, i.e.,
        \begin{equation}
            c_1e_{t_1}+\dotsb + c_re_{t_r}=0.
        \end{equation}
        Let's check the coefficients of $[t_r]$. Since there is
        \begin{equation}
            e_{t_j} = \sum_{\pi\in C_{t_j}}\sgn(\pi)\pi[t_j],
        \end{equation}
        and by Lemma \ref{lem: leq} we have $\pi[t_j]\geq[t_j]\neq [t_r]$, unless $\pi=\id$ and $j=r$. Thus by taking the inner product with $[t_r]$, we have
        \begin{equation}
            \lr<>{c_1e_{t_1}+\dotsb + c_re_{t_r}, [t_r]} = c_r = 0.
        \end{equation}
        Since $r$ is arbitary, it completes the proof.
    \end{proof}

    To prove that the polytabloids associated with the Young tableaux spans $S^\lambda$, we need some techniques. Let's start with some definition.

    \begin{definition}[Composition]
        A \emph{composition} of $n$ is a tuple $\lambda=(\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_l)$ of positive integers such that $\lambda_1 + \dotsb + \lambda_l=n$.
    \end{definition}

    The definition of a tableau, a tabloid, a polytabloid and the dominance order can be extended to composition in a natural way. We shall now define the dominance order on tabloids.

    Suppose that $[t^\lambda]$ is a tabloid with $\lambda$ a composition. For each index $i$ with $1\leq i\leq n$, let $[t^{\lambda_i}]$ be the tabloid formed by all elements no greater than $i$ in $[t]$, and let $\lambda_i$ be the corresponding composition of $i$.

    \begin{definition}[Dominance Order on Tabloids]
        Let $t^\lambda$ and $s^\mu$ be two tabloids with composition sequences $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_i$, respectively. Then $[t^\lambda]$ dominates $[s^\mu]$, denoted by $[t^\lambda]\unrhd [s^\mu]$, if $\lambda_i\unrhd\mu_i$ for all $i$.
    \end{definition}

    Notice that if $t$ and $s$ are two $\lambda$-tabloid with $\lambda$ being a partition, then $[t]\unrhd [s]$ implies $[t]>[s]$. Just as for partitions, there is a dominance lemma for tabloids.

    \begin{lemma}[Dominance Lemma for Tabloids]\label{lem: dom-tab}
        If $k<l$ and $k$ appears in a lower row than $l$ in $[t]$, then $(k l)[t]\rhd[t]$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        The lemma follows from checking the composition sequences for both tabloids.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        If $t$ is standard and $\lr<>{[s], e_t}\neq 0$, then $[t]\unrhd [s]$.
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{proof}
        By the definition of $e_t$, we can assume that $s=\pi t$, where $\pi\in C_t$. Induct on the number of column inversions in $s$, that is, the number of pairs $k<l$ in the same column of $s$ such that $k$ is in a lower row than $l$. By Lemma \ref{lem: dom-tab} we have $(k l)[s]\rhd[s]$, and it is easy to find out that $(k l)[s]$ has fewer inversions than $[s]$. Since $[t]$ has no inversions, then by induction we have $[t]\unrhd[s]$.
    \end{proof}

    Now it is ready to introduce the \emph{straightening algorithm}, which takes any standard tableau $t$ and writes the associated polytabloids $e_t$ in terms of other polytabloids associated with standard Young tableaux.

    Take a $\lambda$-tableau $t$. There exist some $\sigma\in C_t$ such that all columns of $s = \sigma t$ are in increasing order. Then $e_{s}=\pm e_{t}$ by easy calculation from the definition. If the tableau $s$ is not standard, then there must be two adjacent entries in the same row where the left is greater than the right, which is called a row descent. Denote by $A$ the entries below the left row-descending entry (including itself) and by $B$ the entries above the right row-descending entry (including itself), which is illustrated in \ref{fig: straightening}. The \emph{Garnir element}, denoted by $g_{A, B}$, is the signed sum of all permutations of $A\cup B$ that keep both subsets $A$ and $B$ without column descents, that is,
    \begin{equation}
        g_{A, B}=\sum_{\pi\in\Pi}\sgn(\pi)\phi^\lambda_\pi,
    \end{equation}
    where $\Pi$ is the collection of such permutations.

    \begin{figure}[htb]

        \caption{$s$ is a tableau such that all columns are in increasing order, where $a_i>b_i$ is a row descent. The set $A$ is the collection of yellow entries $a_i, \dotsc, a_p$, and the set $B$ is the collection of cyan entries $b_1, \dotsc, b_i$, where $b_1<\dotsb <b_i<a_i<\dotsb < a_p$.}
        \label{fig: straightening}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem: Garnir}
        Let $s$ be a $\lambda$-tableau with no column descents and $g_{A, B}$ be a corresponding Garnir element. Then we have
        \begin{equation}
            g_{A, B}(e_t) = \sum_{\pi\in\Pi}(\sgn(\pi)\phi_\pi^\lambda(e_t))=0.
        \end{equation}
    \end{lemma}

    Moreover, it is true for $\lambda$-tableau $t$ which has column descents, since $e_t=\pm e_s$.

    \begin{proof}
        First, notice that
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                g_{A, B}(e_s)
                &= \sum_{\pi\in\Pi}\sgn(\pi)\phi_\pi^\lambda(e_s)\\
                &= \sum_{\pi\in\Pi}\sum_{\tau\in C_s}\sgn(\pi\tau)\pi\tau[s]\\
                &= \sum_{\pi\tau\in S_{A\cup B}}\sgn(\pi\tau)\pi\tau[s],
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        where $S_{A\cup B}$ stands for the set of all permutations which fix the elements outside $A\cup B$. For a given tableau $s$ and all $\sigma\in S_{A\cup B}$, there exist two adjacent elements $a$ and $b$ in $s$, and a transposition of the two elements denoted $(a b)$, where $(a b)\sigma[s] = \sigma[s]$. If we call $\sigma\sim (a b)\sigma$, then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation where every equivalence class has exactly two elements. Since
        \begin{equation}
            \sgn(\sigma)\sigma[s] + \sgn\left((a b)\sigma\right)(a b)\sigma[t] = \sgn(\sigma)\left(\sigma[s]-(a b)\sigma[t]\right) = 0,
        \end{equation}
        then the whole expression cancels to 0.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
        The standard $\lambda$-polytabloids spans $S^\lambda$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        It suffices to show that every polytabloid $e_s$ with no column descents can be represented as a linear combination of polytabloids each of whose corresponding tabloid is greater than $s$ under dominance order of tabloids.

        Take $A=\{a_i, \dotsc, a_p\}$ and $B = \{b_1, \dotsc, b_i\}$ with
        \begin{equation}
            b_1<\dotsb <b_i<a_i<\dotsb <a_p.
        \end{equation}
        as is illustrated in \ref{fig: straightening}.

        By Lemma \ref{lem: Garnir} and Theorem \ref{thm: poly-commu}, there is
        \begin{equation}
            e_s = \mp\sum_{\pi\in(\Pi-\{\id\})}\sgn(\pi)e_{\pi s}.
        \end{equation}
        It follows from the dominance lemma that $[\pi s]\unrhd[s]$ for all $\pi\neq \id$.
    \end{proof}
